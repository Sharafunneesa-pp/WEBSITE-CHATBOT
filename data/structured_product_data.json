Further, you\n                        and Nutrinova agree to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in Orange County,\n                        California, to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in\n                        connection with these Terms or Nutrinova products that is not subject to mandatory arbitration under\n                        the Arbitration Agreement below, and waive any jurisdictional, venue, or inconvenient forum\n                        objections to such courts. 17.0 Arbitration Agreement This Arbitration Agreement section sets forth the terms and conditions pursuant to which\n                            disputes, claims and controversies between you and Nutrinova will be resolved through\n                            Arbitration (\u201cArbitration Agreement\u201d). Dispute resolution and arbitration You and Nutrinova agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Nutrinova arising in\n                        connection with or relating in any way to these Terms or to your use of any Nutrinova products\n                        (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory,\n                        and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of these Terms) will be determined\n                        by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration. You and Nutrinova further agree that the\n                        arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any\n                        objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to\n                        the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim. THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND\n                        COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED. The arbitrator must follow these Terms and can\n                        award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees and costs only where\n                        allowable under applicable law), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including\n                        declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration. This\n                        arbitration provision will survive termination of these Terms. Exceptions You and Nutrinova both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive,\n                        preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to bring an individual action\n                        (1) in a U.S. small claims court or (2) in a court of law, in accordance with the jurisdiction\n                        and venue described in the \u201cChoice of Law and Venue\u201d section above, seeking (a) only temporary\n                        or preliminary individualized injunctive relief, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator or\n                        (b) public injunctive relief, pending a ruling on the substance of such claim from the\n                        arbitrator. In addition, nothing in this provision prevents you or us from bringing issues to\n                        the attention of federal, state, or local agencies. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek\n                        relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa). No Class or Representative Proceedings; Class Action Waiver YOU AND Nutrinova AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL\n                        CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\n                        Unless both you and Nutrinova agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person's\n                        claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The\n                        arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and\n                        only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. If a\n                        court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph's limitations\n                        as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from\n                        the arbitration and may be brought in court. Arbitration rules Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings. Any arbitration between you and Nutrinova will\n                        take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\")\n                        then in force (the \"AAA Rules\"), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. You and Nutrinova agree\n                        that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this\n                        provision (despite the choice of law provision above). Any arbitration hearings will be conducted by phone or videoconference to the extent possible,\n                        but if the arbitrator determines that a hearing should be conducted in person, the locale for\n                        such hearing shall be determined by the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules. The costs of arbitration (including attorney fees) shall be borne by the losing party, unless\n                        otherwise determined by the arbitration award. Notice A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the\n                        other, by electronic mail to [email\u00a0protected] and by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or\n                        Express Mail (signature required) to the address below (\"Notice\"). Nutrinova\u2019s address for Notice\n                        is: Nutrialliance LLC, Attn: 1993 Dewer Drive Suite 1 #134 Rock Springs, WY 82901, USA. The Notice must (1)\n                        describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (2) set forth the specific relief\n                        sought (\"Demand\"). We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we\n                        do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Nutrinova may\n                        commence an arbitration proceeding. Enforceability If this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the\n                        exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in the \u201cChoice of Law and Venue\u201d section above shall\n                        govern with respect to any aspect of any dispute, claim or controversy that, as a result of such\n                        invalidation, is no longer governed by this Arbitration Agreement. 18.0 Termination This Agreement is effective unless and until terminated by either you or Nutrinova. You may\n                        terminate this Agreement at any time by providing written notice to Nutrinova. Nutrinova may terminate\n                        this Agreement at any time without notice and may deny your access to the Site if in our sole\n                        judgment you fail to comply with any term or provision of this Agreement. The termination date\n                        shall serve as the termination of the Agreement for all purposes. Get Our Latest Offers, Gifts & more...
